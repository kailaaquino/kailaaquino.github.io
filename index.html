                My name is <strong>Kaila Aquino</strong>, I am a fourth year
                <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at Cal Poly SLO.
                </p>
                <h2><strong>About me:</strong></h2>
                I am passionate about the process of developing software, from
                brainstorming ideas to delivering the final product. <br />
                Planning project flows and designing intuitive user interfaces with Figma
                prototypes are some of my favorite aspects!<br />
                Currently, I’m managing an e-commerce database by writing an API for a
                fictional potion shop as part of my databases class. <br />
                I'm actively seeking internship and job opportunities for Summer 2025.
