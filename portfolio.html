          This website is my first portfolio project, where I showcase my

        <h2>Price Plate</h2>
        <p>
          This is my first full stack development project, created in
          collaboration with four other team members. The app is designed for
          financially aware grocery shoppers, allowing users to track and
          understand their spending habits more deeply. The main functionality
          includes tracking expenses, logging recipe and ingredient costs, and
          maintaining an inventory of ingredients. Unlike other budget apps,
          Price Plate lets users calculate specific expenses per serving for
          recipes and ingredients, offering precise cost insights.

        <h2>Another Project</h2>
        <p>
          This Figma prototype was created in collaboration with three other
          members during a 24-hour design-a-thon for UX Fest at Cal Poly. The
          app is designed to help college students with limited cooking
          experience and time constraints by offering quick, user-friendly meal
          recipes. Users can add recipes to a meal planner, create grocery
          lists, and get personalized recipe recommendations from an AI chatbot
          based on available ingredients and time. The prototype features a
          clean and intuitive design, refined through user research and feedback
          from industry mentors.
